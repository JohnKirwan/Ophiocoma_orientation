Ophiocoma analysis

This repository contains markdown documents and data files from analysis of
photodetection in brittlestars of the Ophiocoma genus. The file
Ophiocoma_orientation_I describes statistical analysis of the orientation
of Ophiocoma spp. in relation to photic stimuli in a cylindrical
behavioural arena. Ophiocoma_orientation_II describes further analyses in
which Ophiocoma pumila undergoes similar experiments with differing light
and circadian conditions. Ophiocoma_receptors describes simple calculations
regarding the apertures and angular sensitivity of putative receptors.
