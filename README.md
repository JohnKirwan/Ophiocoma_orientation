# Ophiocoma_orientation

This repository contains markdown documents and data files from analysis of
photodetection in brittlestars of the *Ophiocoma* genus. This is describe in the [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.042) "Extraocular Vision in a Brittle Star Is Mediated by Chromatophore Movement in Response to Ambient Light" by Sumner-Rooney et al. (2020).

The files (other than Ophiocoma_receptors and Ophiocoma_receptor_data) describe statistical analysis of the orientation of *Ophiocoma* spp. in relation to photic stimuli in a cylindrical behavioural arena. The file Ophiocoma_orientation_preparation includes pre-processing and analyses prior to modelling. Ophiocoma_binomial_modelling and Ophiocoma_von_Mises_modelling decribe modelling of orientation according to a binomial distribution and von Mises distribution respectively. Ophiocoma_receptors describes simple calculations regarding the apertures and angular sensitivity of putative receptors.
Analyses were performed with R 3.6.1, rstan 2.19.2 and brms 2.10.0.
