# Ophiocoma_orientation

This repository contains markdown documents and data files from analysis of
photodetection in brittlestars of the *Ophiocoma* genus. The files (other than Ophiocoma_receptors and Ophiocoma_receptor_data) describe statistical analysis of the orientation of *Ophiocoma* spp. in relation to photic stimuli in a cylindrical
behavioural arena. The file Ophiocoma_orientation_preparation includes pre-processing and analyses prior to modelling. Ophiocoma_binomial_modelling and Ophiocoma_von_Mises_modelling decribe modelling of orientation according to a binomial distribution and von Mises distribution respectively. Ophiocoma_receptors describes simple calculations
regarding the apertures and angular sensitivity of putative receptors.
